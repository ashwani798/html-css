            <h2>DODO</h2>
            <P>The **Dodo** (Raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless bird that was native to the island of Mauritius, which is located in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar. The dodo is one of the most famous examples of human-induced extinction. Here are some key points about the dodo bird:

                1. **Extinction:** The dodo became extinct in the late 17th century. The exact date of its extinction is not precisely known, but it is widely believed to have disappeared by the 1680s. The arrival of humans and the animals they brought with them to Mauritius, including rats, pigs, and monkeys, led to the rapid decline of the dodo population.
                
                2. **Physical Characteristics:** Dodos were relatively large birds, about 3.3 feet (1 meter) tall and weighing around 20-23 kilograms (44-51 pounds). They had a plump body, short wings, a large head, and a hooked beak. Dodos had a greyish-blue plumage, a naked, pale yellow head, and black, stout legs.
                
                3. **Behavior:** Dodos were flightless, and their inability to fly made them vulnerable to predators. It is believed that they primarily fed on fruits, nuts, and seeds. Because they had no natural predators on Mauritius, they did not develop strong defenses.
                
                4. **Discovery and Name:** The dodo was first mentioned by Dutch sailors in the late 16th century. The origin of the name "dodo" is uncertain, but it is thought to come from the Dutch word "dodaars," which means "fat-bottomed" or "sluggard." This name might have been given due to the bird's clumsy appearance.
                
                5. **Cultural Significance:** Despite its relatively short existence, the dodo has become an iconic symbol of extinct species and environmental conservation. It is often used in literature, art, and popular culture to represent extinct or outdated things.
                
                The dodo's story serves as a cautionary tale about the impact of human activity on the natural world, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to prevent the extinction of other species.</P>
